## Anki plants

Here is an Anki deck if you are interested in learning more about plants taxonomy.

https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594735105

You have more than 4800 genus of chemically studied plants to learn !

Use the desktop app with a browser side by side in order to easily fetch info (general aspects, medicinal uses, facts, geography) which will help you memorize the plants.

You can the get a bunch of stats telling you how bad you are ... Repetition is key. (I have not been looking at these in the last 2 months)
But I think that a small period of learning each 2/3 days is great. What I did not cath is a way to get reminder from Anki, since it's objective is to schedule the relearning this could be a useful option. Have to check this.

Stats that you can get from the Anki deck soft
