# dendron export markdown preview note to html and share
2021-01-28 09:46

For now I need to manually save the file to .html and share it via a dropbox link.
MPE has an export_on_save option however this is not active in Dendron MPE Could it be possible to have in activated.
Else what are the option you would propose to share an html rendered markdown file (ideally with a clickable TOC as a sidebar)


# dendron snippets definition
~~I changed my workspace to the direct upper level (in order to have dendron.yml file and all in the VSCode sidebar). It appears to work however now i dont have more completion of my snippets (todo, time etc.)
Is it linked ?~~ Yes, as I understand it now, the snippets should be in the dendron.code-snippets.json file in the .vscode folder of the current workspace.



# dendron copy notes across vaults


vault1
    root
    notes
    project
    project.pr1
    project.pr1.context
vault2
    root
    blabla
    project
    project.pr1
    project.pr1.context
