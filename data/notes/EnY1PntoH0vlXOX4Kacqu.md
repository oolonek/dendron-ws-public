So actually looking at https://dendron.so/notes/8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821.html it appears that the way to tag a note is just exactly the same as the way you would link it.
Lets try both with an existing tag/note and an unexisting on.

Existing is [[tools.organization.digitalgardens]] and non existing is [[spatial.exploration]].

Pretty version [[#explo|spatial.explo]]

 //TODO Sublime ZK-like tag system. It would be really nice to have tag proposition and autocompletion
 Suggest or ask in dendron discord.
