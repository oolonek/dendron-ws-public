## Some starting points regarding the publishing of research ideas:

* very rough https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc

* more formally https://riojournal.com/browse_journal_articles.php?form_name=filter_articles&sortby=0&journal_id=17&search_in_=0&section_type%5B%5D=179

//TODO Publish an hyper-early stage research project idea on Rio

* community-centric https://jogl.io

* Journal of Brief Ideas
https://beta.briefideas.org/about

* Nano publications 
http://nanopub.org/wordpress/
Linked to RDF ? Didnt understand why ...


Data curation is somehow a neglected aspect of academic research

> Data science 80% data wrangling and 20 % of cool stuff
> 

No "dynamics" view of the evolution of research ideas / objects

Snapshots :

* video not doable
* internet archive not precise enough, tedious

some similarities with Inciteful.xyz ?

ðŸ¤”  thoughts : do we only need tools enabling to link/aggregate resources within discipline. Or should we also think about ways to enable links across disciplines. This comes with challenges : not the same keywords, not the same vocabulary potentially different way to share knowledge.

## Open research

 Share it as soon as you get the result/data but also idea/process

> the blue obelisk project link is not active on Peter's page. To fix.
So in fact there is no link to the french page of the blue obelisk project. 
See how to make an interlanguage link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage_links#:~:text=This%20help%20page%20is%20a%20how%2Dto%20guide.&text=It%20is%20not%20one%20of,levels%20of%20consensus%20and%20vetting.&text=Interlanguage%20links%20are%20links%20from,equivalent%20page%20in%20another%20language.&text=As%20links%20in%20the%20%22Languages%22%20section%20of%20the%20page's%20left%20sidebar

## Concrete societal impact of research / open-research

Underestimating the Challenges of Avoiding a Ghastly Future

Note the Ghastly keyword 

> We should marketing specialist prepare our research paper titles so they get picked up by the media !


## Documenting research is also valuable for teaching.

If you have open access to lab book of a researcher then students can at least no stay in the textbooks only but also get a direct feeling or even interaction (pull request/comments) of frontier research.
