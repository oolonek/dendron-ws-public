<p>When reading an article on the internet it could be useful to have a plugin able to completely remove active links (so they dont atract the attention anymore.)
This should greatly enhance the readers attention by giving a "book like" feeling.</p>

It has a bunch of options, however I found that at the end of the day I am not using it that often. There is still work to do on such plugins to have a better reading experience.
Very interested in quick and convenient ways to pass from retro-lightened screen > e-ink/paper like reading exp. (apart from printing the pages)</p>
<p>A plugin that I installed more recently but which I use more (because its automatically acting also ) is a tab limitator Nuff Tabs
