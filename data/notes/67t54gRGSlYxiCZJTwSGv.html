<p>There is a guy in the dendron community using Anki (<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">https://apps.ankiweb.net/</a>)</p>

<p>//TODO Investigate this </p>

<p>Here is an Anki deck if you are interested in learning more about plants taxonomy.</p>
<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594735105">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594735105</a></p>
<p>You have more than 4800 genus of chemically studied plants to learn !</p>
<p>Use the desktop app with a browser side by side in order to easily fetch info (general aspects, medicinal uses, facts, geography) which will help you memorize the plants.</p>
<p>You can the get a bunch of stats telling you how bad you are ... Repetition is key. (I have not been looking at these in the last 2 months)
But I think that a small period of learning each 2/3 days is great. What I did not cath is a way to get reminder from Anki, since it's objective is to schedule the relearning this could be a useful option. Have to check this.</p>
<p>Stats that you can get from the Anki deck soft
