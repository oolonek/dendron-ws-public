# What is the difference between frequentist and bayesian inferences ?

https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/56

Here is how I would explain the basic difference to my grandma:

I have misplaced my phone somewhere in the home. I can use the phone locator on the base of the instrument to locate the phone and when I press the phone locator the phone starts beeping.

Problem: Which area of my home should I search?

## Frequentist Reasoning
I can hear the phone beeping. I also have a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming. Therefore, upon hearing the beep, I infer the area of my home I must search to locate the phone.

## Bayesian Reasoning
I can hear the phone beeping. Now, apart from a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from, I also know the locations where I have misplaced the phone in the past. So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.


Response two is of interest also !

A Bayesian is one who, vaguely expecting a horse, and catching
a glimpse of a donkey, strongly believes he has seen a mule

# Application to Mandelbrot project
Bayesian are especially powerful for functional optimization.
In the frame of the mandelbrot project we could try to functionalize our drug discovery quest < this alone is a big part of the problem. 

- an ensemble of molecules found to be present in various amount in plants displaying a high inhibitory activity and a low cytotoxicity.
- the more this ensemble of molecules is restricted and unique to the highly bioactive plants, the more they are the potential responsible of this bioactivity.
- some priors could be defined: we know that scaffold X and Y usually display these activities.
