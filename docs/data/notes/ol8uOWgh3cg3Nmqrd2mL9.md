Looking to display and share .gpx data 

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RandomFractalsInc.geo-data-viewer

It is apparently possible to add .csv data to an existing .gpx map
https://docs.kepler.gl/docs/user-guides/b-kepler-gl-workflow/a-add-data-to-the-map#csv

I used https://geogeek.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/coordinate_converter.xlsx to convert UTM coord to decimal lon lat. Not ideal but did the job.

You can then add and combine .gpx or csv of lat long in the geo-data-viewer and export the .html.
When you open this one it will be opened in the kepler website. There you can export as shareable html (dont forget to add your personal token)
Here is an example [finca](../../../../../Users/pma/Dropbox/dendron/vault/assets/private.assets/terreno_pma_kepler.gl.html)
