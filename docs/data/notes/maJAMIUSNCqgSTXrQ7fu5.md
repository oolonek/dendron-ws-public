## What's after wilderness  🏔️ 🦖

This note initially came after the dendron introduction [[dendron]] ... but let's put it as a welcome word !

### What is this ?

You might find  a lot of stuff on this personal dendron website. It has for objective to be used as a dump for ideas, todo lists, read lists, ... [fill the dots] or an electronic lab notebook. You can see it as a digital experiment aiming to gather :

- [ ] academic research material of exploratory projects around natural products, biodiversity & ecology - instead of presenting final object we will rather follow an [anti-marketing approach](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS)

You can see it as: 

- [ ] a garage, lab and a workshop with [open doors](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). See related notes here [[garage]]

### Why ?

It is a first attempt to commit to :

- [ ] a public [[pledge]] (inspired by Daniel Mietchen).

### And then what ?

Pass at the workshop and grab a coffee ☕ or whatever you like. Let's chat ! Help me grow this dendron, let's add leaves 🍃 or prune ✂️ branches together 🤝 !
