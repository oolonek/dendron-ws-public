<p>Here is how I would explain the basic difference to my grandma:</p>
<p>I have misplaced my phone somewhere in the home. I can use the phone locator on the base of the instrument to locate the phone and when I press the phone locator the phone starts beeping.</p>
<p>Problem: Which area of my home should I search?</p>

<p>I can hear the phone beeping. I also have a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming. Therefore, upon hearing the beep, I infer the area of my home I must search to locate the phone.</p>

<p>I can hear the phone beeping. Now, apart from a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from, I also know the locations where I have misplaced the phone in the past. So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.</p>
<p>Response two is of interest also !

<p>A Bayesian is one who, vaguely expecting a horse, and catching
a glimpse of a donkey, strongly believes he has seen a mule</p>

<p>Bayesian are especially powerful for functional optimization.
In the frame of the mandelbrot project we could try to functionalize our drug discovery quest &#x3C; this alone is a big part of the problem. </p>
<ul>
<li>an ensemble of molecules found to be present in various amount in plants displaying a high inhibitory activity and a low cytotoxicity.</li>
<li>the more this ensemble of molecules is restricted and unique to the highly bioactive plants, the more they are the potential responsible of this bioactivity.</li>
<li>some priors could be defined: we know that scaffold X and Y usually display these activities.</li>
</ul>
