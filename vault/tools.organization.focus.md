When reading an article on the internet it could be useful to have a plugin able to completely remove active links (so they dont atract the attention anymore.)
This should greatly enhance the readers attention by giving a "book like" feeling.

Added since some month the "Decreased Productivity" plugin on chromium browser https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decreased-productivity/nlbpiflhmdcklcbihngeffpmoklbiooj
Produced by https://www.andryou.com/
It has a bunch of options, however I found that at the end of the day I am not using it that often. There is still work to do on such plugins to have a better reading experience. 
Very interested in quick and convenient ways to pass from retro-lightened screen > e-ink/paper like reading exp. (apart from printing the pages)

A plugin that I installed more recently but which I use more (because its automatically acting also ) is a tab limitator Nuff Tabs
