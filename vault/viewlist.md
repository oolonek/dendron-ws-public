Notes : 
- Percian definition of signs (tryptic) sign-object-interpreter 

- Biosemiotics as a part of semiotics considers the manners in which meaning arises through various forms of mediations such as signs, indices, indexes, symbols and the //www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman

- Complex in the sense that it cannot be understood at only one level or through one theory (maybe the difference with complicated)

To understand complex phenomena we should have complex theories

Kropotkin : as a critic to Darwin. Nature is not one unique and giant battlefield.
K. Marx viewed Darwin theory as Adam's Smith (linberal economist) views applied to nature and evolution. < Theory within a field can be influenced by theories external to the field.

A friendly introduction to Bayes Theorem and Hidden Markov Models
https://github.com/luisguiserrano/hmm

Such approaches seem perfectly adapted to noisy datasets such as mass spec data from which we would like to fish signal related to bioactive analytes.
We have some priors bioactivity of the extracts, previously reported scaffolds on the target
We could propagate information about seed compounds trough spectral similarity, seeing cos score aa a coarse probability of the molecule showing the same properties then the seed.
Check for existing implementations of Bayesian approach in drug discovery or in the exploration of mass spectral data set.

- A quick thought experiment : "Imagine yourself and your banc account in 20 years ... What if it didn't change ? Would you see this as a failure ?" 

- investigate "commodities" ... could well be the root of the problem. We want to be confortable. We are dissatisfied. If you work on contentment and help people to encounter contentment and satisfaction in any situation you abolish the whole problem. See Ushiyama and Sawaki
- manufacture of dissapointment
- check what is "feminist economists" not clear
- 2nd taught experiment "the speed of a car" by Ivan Illitch >> 16 km/h

[[#idea|tag.idea]] should we advocate and work toward a degrowth approach in academics. **publish less.**
