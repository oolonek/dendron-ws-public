A friendly introduction to Bayes Theorem and Hidden Markov Models
https://github.com/luisguiserrano/hmm

Such approaches seem perfectly adapted to noisy datasets such as mass spec data from which we would like to fish signal related to bioactive analytes.
We have some priors bioactivity of the extracts, previously reported scaffolds on the target
We could propagate information about seed compounds trough spectral similarity, seeing cos score aa a coarse probability of the molecule showing the same properties then the seed.
Check for existing implementations of Bayesian approach in drug discovery or in the exploration of mass spectral data set.

- A quick thought experiment : "Imagine yourself and your banc account in 20 years ... What if it didn't change ? Would you see this as a failure ?" 

- investigate "commodities" ... could well be the root of the problem. We want to be confortable. We are dissatisfied. If you work on contentment and help people to encounter contentment and satisfaction in any situation you abolish the whole problem. See Ushiyama and Sawaki
- manufacture of dissapointment
- check what is "feminist economists" not clear
- 2nd taught experiment "the speed of a car" by Ivan Illitch >> 16 km/h
