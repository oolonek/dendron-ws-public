Working on the DBGI Dendron 404 issue.
This happened allready. Solved it. Didnt take notes. Here I am again.

Let's update the dendron cli 

`npm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest`

Ok. This one was quick. Solved. Now.


Filed an issue for the llokup of such note here https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/3676
