So in the dendron-ws-publi we also have a projects architecture.

We can for example reference to Martin Dupont' top secret project [[projects.martin-dupont]] however, this one should only be visible if you are on the dendron-ws-private or dendron-global repos or website.
Let's see if this is the case.
